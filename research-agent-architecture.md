  "estimated_completion": "90%"
}
```

**Result Report** (SubAgent → LeadResearcher):
```json
{
  "type": "RESULT_REPORT",
  "task_id": "uuid",
  "findings": [
    {
      "claim": "...",

---

## 4. Prompt Engineering Strategy

### 4.1 Core Principles

**Mental Model Development**:
- Simulate agent interactions before deployment
- Identify failure modes through testing
- Iterate on prompts based on observed behavior

**Delegation Training**:
- Explicit heuristics for when to delegate
- Clear task boundary definitions
- Examples of good vs. bad delegation

**Effort Scaling**:
```
Simple query (< 2 dimensions) → No subagents, LeadResearcher handles directly
Medium query (2-3 dimensions) → 2-3 subagents
Complex query (4+ dimensions) → 4-5 subagents
```

**Guardrails**:
- Maximum recursion depth: 2 levels
- Subagent timeout: 5 minutes
- Token budget per subagent: 50k tokens
- Spiral detection: flag if same search repeated 3+ times

### 4.2 Extended Thinking Mode

**Configuration**:
```
<thinking>
[Agent reasoning before taking action]
- What is the goal?
- What information do I have?
- What information do I need?
- What's the best next step?
- Should I delegate or handle directly?
</thinking>
```

**Interleaved Thinking** (after tool use):
```
<tool_result>
[Web search results]
</tool_result>

<thinking>
[Evaluate results]
- Are these sources authoritative?
- Do they answer my question?
- Do I need more information?
- Should I narrow my search?
</thinking>
```

## 7. Deployment Infrastructure

### 7.1 Checkpointing System

**Checkpoint Strategy**:
```python
class CheckpointManager:
    def save_checkpoint(self, session_id: str, state: SystemState):
        """Save system state at regular intervals"""
        checkpoint = {
            'timestamp': now(),
            'session_id': session_id,
            'lead_state': state.lead_researcher,
            'subagent_states': state.subagents,
            'results': state.collected_results,
            'errors': state.error_log
        }
        self.storage.save(checkpoint)

    def restore_from_checkpoint(self, session_id: str) -> SystemState:
        """Restore system state after failure"""
        checkpoint = self.storage.load(session_id)
        return SystemState.from_checkpoint(checkpoint)
```

**Checkpoint Intervals**:
- After each subagent completion
- Every 60 seconds during active research
- Before and after synthesis phase
- On any critical error

### 7.2 Retry Logic

**Retry Strategy**:
```python
@retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff=exponential_backoff(base=2, max_delay=60),
    retry_on=[NetworkError, TimeoutError, RateLimitError]
)
def execute_subagent_task(task: ResearchTask) -> AgentResult:
    """Execute research task with automatic retry"""
    pass
```

**Failure Handling**:
1. **Transient failure** → retry with backoff
2. **Persistent failure** → reassign to different subagent
3. **Critical failure** → escalate to LeadResearcher
4. **Systemic failure** → checkpoint and alert

### 7.3 Tracing & Logging

**Distributed Tracing**:
```python
class ResearchTracer:
    def trace_request(self, query: str) -> Trace:
        """Create trace for entire research session"""
        return Trace(
            session_id=generate_id(),
            query=query,
            start_time=now()
        )

    def log_agent_action(self, trace: Trace, agent_id: str, action: Action):
        """Log individual agent action with context"""
        trace.add_event({
            'timestamp': now(),
            'agent_id': agent_id,
            'action_type': action.type,
            'input': action.input,
            'output': action.output,
            'duration_ms': action.duration,
            'tokens_used': action.tokens
        })
```

**Log Levels**:
- **DEBUG**: All agent thoughts and decisions
- **INFO**: Agent spawning, task completion, major milestones
- **WARN**: Retries, degraded performance, unusual patterns
- **ERROR**: Failures, exceptions, data loss

### 7.4 Progressive Rollout

**Rainbow Deployment Strategy**:
```
Week 1: 5% traffic  → Monitor core metrics
Week 2: 15% traffic → Validate at scale
Week 3: 35% traffic → Check edge cases
Week 4: 65% traffic → Build confidence
Week 5: 100% traffic → Full rollout
```

**Rollback Criteria**:

## 9. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 9.1 Challenge: Stateful Agent Coordination

**Problem**: Managing state across multiple parallel agents with complex dependencies

**Solution**:
- Immutable message passing
- Centralized state store with versioning
- Checkpoint at critical junctures
- Clear ownership boundaries (LeadResearcher owns aggregation state)

### 9.2 Challenge: Error Propagation

**Problem**: When subagent fails, how does it impact overall research?

**Solution**:
- Graceful degradation (continue with available results)
- Task reassignment (redistribute failed tasks)
- Partial result utilization (use what worked)
- Escalation protocol (critical failures bubble up)

### 9.3 Challenge: Context Window Limits

**Problem**: Individual agents hit context limits on complex queries

**Solution**:
- Parallel context windows (each subagent independent)
- Strategic summarization (compress intermediate findings)
- Hierarchical information flow (subagent → lead → final)
- Tool-based memory (external storage for large datasets)

### 9.4 Challenge: When to Parallelize vs Sequence

**Problem**: Some research requires sequential steps (can't parallelize everything)

**Solution**:
- Dependency detection in prompts
- Teach LeadResearcher to identify prerequisites
- Multi-stage research (Phase 1 parallel → Phase 2 uses Phase 1 results)
- Example: "First understand X (parallel), then analyze impact on Y (sequential)"

### 9.5 Challenge: Token Budget Optimization

**Problem**: Token usage explains 80% of performance, but costs scale linearly

**Solution**:
- Adaptive depth (simple queries use fewer tokens)
- Lazy evaluation (only spawn subagents when needed)
- Result caching (reuse previous findings)
- Prompt compression (efficient templates)

### 9.6 Challenge: Non-Deterministic Behavior

**Problem**: Same query produces different results, making debugging hard

**Solution**:
- Seed control for testing
- Comprehensive tracing (log all decisions)
- Deterministic evaluation (same test set)
- Statistical validation (run multiple times, average results)

         ├─ SubAgent2: Environmental impacts (carbon emissions, urban planning)
         ├─ SubAgent3: Social impacts (mental health, inequality, community)
         ├─ SubAgent4: COVID-specific changes (before/after comparison)
         └─ SubAgent5: Future projections and policy implications
         ↓
    Parallel execution (5 agents)
         ↓
    Monitor progress:

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable, robust foundation for building a multi-agent research system modeled after Anthropic's approach. The key to success lies in:

1. **Effective prompt engineering** - Teaching agents to delegate and synthesize
2. **Robust error handling** - Graceful degradation and recovery
3. **Comprehensive evaluation** - Continuous quality monitoring
4. **Token optimization** - Maximizing value per token spent
5. **Iterative refinement** - Start simple, add complexity progressively

Start with Phase 1 (basic orchestrator-worker pattern) and validate the core concept before investing in advanced features. The system should demonstrate clear improvement over single-agent baseline before moving to production deployment.
